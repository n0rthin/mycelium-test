# mycelium-test

The future is dozens or hundreds autonomous agents working with each other to reach a common goal. But making agents to communicatea and collaborate with each other is hard. When one agent should talk to another? Which agent it needs to talk to? How to make agents that can delegate task and report on task completion? What about more complex structures like teams or organizations?

All thees questions don't have a clear answer. Only certain thing is that we'll iterate over numerous different solutions to find a perfect one. And we will need a tool for testing these solutions. Here's where **myceliym-test** comes in.
**mycelium-test** is framework for automatic testing of collaborating LLM-based agents. It's implemenation agnostic and provides necessary tools to make iterations faster.

This framework is itentended to be a part of larger project called [Mycelium](https://github.com/n0rthin/mycelium): an atempt at making scallable and extendable solution for agents communication.

**mycelium-test is in super early stages**
