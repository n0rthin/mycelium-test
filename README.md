# mycelium-test

The future is hundreds or thousands of autonomous agents working together to achieve a common goal. However, enabling these agents to communicate and collaborate with each other is challenging. When should one agent communicate with another? Which agent does it need to talk to? How can we create agents capable of delegating tasks and reporting on their completion? What about more complex structures like teams or organizations?

All these questions lack clear answers. The only certainty is that we will iterate over numerous different solutions to find the perfect one. And for this, we will need a tool to test these solutions. This is where **myceliym-test** comes in.
**mycelium-test** is a framework for the automatic testing of collaborating LLM-based agents. It is implementation-agnostic and provides the necessary tools to expedite iterations.

This framework is intended to be part of a larger project called [Mycelium](https://github.com/n0rthin/mycelium): an attempt to create a scalable and extendable solution for agent communication.

**mycelium-test is in its very early stages**
